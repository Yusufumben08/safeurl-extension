To install:

- Download release
- Go to chrome://extensions
- Enable developer mode
- Click load unpacked
- Select extracted release
- Done!

When you click the extension, the url there by default will be the current tabs url. You can change it, or just scan it. It will give you a score for how safe the site is. If the malicious and suspicious score is too high, it likely is a malicious url.
